### Project 1 - Predicting Donors' Income using supervised learning (In progress)
Description:

In this project, I employed several supervised algorithms to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. I then chose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. My goal with this implementation was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.

### Project 2 - Flower Image Classifier Application (In Progress)

### Project 3 - Identifying Customers Segmentations (In Progress)
Description:

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. The data that you will use has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

First, the general demographics data are clustered through a KMeans clustering algorithms, then the same parameters are applied over the customer dataset to investigate if the customers are following the same distributions.

### Project 4 - Data Science Blog (In Progress)
Description:

In this project, I analyzed the 2011 - 2018 Stack Overflow developer survey data in order to create a blog post regarding a comprehensive study of data science careers. The project notebook could be found below

### Project 5 - Disaster Response Pipeline (Completed)
Description:

In this project, I built a data transformation - machine learning pipeline that is capable to curate the class of the messages. The pipeline is eventually built into a flask application. The project include a web app where an emergency worker can input a new message and get classification results in several categories. The web app will also display visualizations of the data.The project notebook could be found below

### Project 6 - Recommendation System (In progress)
Description:

In this project, I developed a recommendation engine's algorithm with IBM communities articles and user interactions. This project will serve as a prototype of the recommender systems of the article recommendation systems of IBM. The project will be hosted on
